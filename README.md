# Java-ArrayProblems
A Java project that includes several utility functions to perform various operations on arrays. This code is designed to help users explore fundamental array manipulations in Java, from calculating sums to identifying unique elements. The project provides a series of methods that demonstrate common tasks and operations with arrays.


# Features
The ArrayProblems class offers the following functionalities:

Traverse Array - Prints the elements of a given array.

Sum of Array - Calculates the sum of all elements in the array.

Find Largest and Smallest Elements - Identifies the largest and smallest elements in the array.

Find Repeating Elements - Lists all elements that appear more than once.

Find Non-Repeating Elements - Lists all unique elements in the array.

Reverse Array - Reverses the order of elements in the array.

Count Frequency of Elements - Calculates the frequency of each element.

Elements at Even and Odd Positions - Separates elements based on their positions (even or odd index).

Search for a Key - Checks if a specific element exists in the array.

Remove Duplicates - Returns an array with duplicate values removed.

Example

Input:


text

Copy code

Enter the size of the array: 5

Enter 5 elements: 2 3 5 3 2

Output:

text

Copy code

Your inputted Array is: 2 3 5 3 2

Sum of all elements of the array is: 15

Smallest element in the array is: 2

Largest element in the array is: 5

All Repeating elements in the given array are: 2 3

All non-repeating elements in the array are: 5

Reverse of the given array is: 2 3 5 3 2

Frequency of each element in the array is: 2:2 3:2 5:1

Elements at even places are: 3 3

Elements at odd places are: 2 5 2

Key found

Array after removing all duplicate elements are: 2 3 5
